# CinemathequeVIFFRatings

Fetches and displays Letterboxd, IMDb and Douban ratings on theCinematheque.ca and viff.org film pages
LB and IMDb have APIs for fast query, while Douban doesn't open its API to public. I am using a shared API key for Douban V2 API. If one day that API key is expired, then it has to do search in Douban and parse to get the info, which means it is slow.
